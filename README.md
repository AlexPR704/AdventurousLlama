# Description:
AdventurousLlama is a web application that allows users to search for local events and connect with new people who are interested in going to the same event they are.

# Concept:
Similar to a dating app, except that instead of matching by liked profile pictures, the app matches you to someone else who has liked the same event you do. We built this web app because we felt it was something that people would actually like and enjoy using. We also liked the idea of a friend or dating app that took away judging someone based on their appearance and concentrated instead on similar interests and providing events to go to together. 

# User Story: 
As someone who is interested in meeting new people and attending fun, local events, I want an easy and fun way to connect with others and find events to go to with new connections. 

# Technologies Used:
React.js, MongoDB, Reactstrap, Bootstrap, Express, Passport.js, Redux, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), TicketMaster API, Node.js

# Features:
User Registration, Authenticated Login, User Profile, Search Local Events, Liked Events Added to User Profile, Connections To Other Users Who Like The Same Event
